Women typically experience less noticeable body odor due to hormonal factors that regulate sweating. Older men have higher rates of excessive or \"strong\" smelling sweat, which contains more protein, uric acid, and fatty acids than normal; as a result, strong-smelling sweat tends to retain its odor longer and requires less exposure time for it to become detectable  - but they also take longer baths with lots of soap! In addition, older adults often suffer from dry skin, poor blood circulation (causing less effective delivery and disposal by the lymphatic system), underexcretion of body salts (including urea) leading to concentrated urine and stools, and constipation/impaction\u2014all contributors toward halitosis (\"stinking breath\"). Finally, many medications are associated with increased sweating, altered senses of taste and smell , or dry mouth \u2014 each being potentially problematic regarding body order .\nIn other words, while not intentionally malicious nor trying to gross anyone out there \u2013 ageing and illness takes its physical & chemical", "score": -1.9591565132141113}

That small container lasted eight whole nights instead of just one because G-d intervened miraculously to save them from being without enough pure oil - thus enabling them to rededicate the menorah fully and properly with new oil each day rather than rushing through using what was available.

Here are some brief excerpts and conclusions from that article:* In the 1920's, after WW I, Germany experienced a wave propaganda about Wagner as allegedly being \u201ca great opponent\u201d or even \u201cvictim\u201d of supposed worldwide \u201cJewish power.\u201d This idea found its origin with Joseph Goebbels and his ministry in the thirties - long before there ever was any mentioning of such claims within academic literature ... It was Goebbel who started to promote this interpretation for propagandistic reasons...It has nothing whatsoever to do either with established scholarship nor with common sense \u2026 * [T]here were many antisemites among his friends \u2013 especially during the early period \u2013 yet he also had many jewish acquaintances throughout all phases of life;", "score": -2.199251413345337}

The question of whether or not any given historical person can be considered non-antisemitic today, is a highly contextualized one, depending on their time in history and culture they were part off - so what would make another persons antisemetic then (in the very same context), could make them progressive / tolerating nowadays; also considering that most antijewish attitudes in wagners times came from within Christian churches themselves, which are by definition no longer antisemitic but quite the opposite - friends & partners with jewry since Vatican II etc.. So while we cannot excuse anything written against Jews before about 1945 , we have no right anymore to judge our ancestors based upon todays values ; those two things simply didnt overlap .

The movement resembles a roundhouse punch followed immediately by a side kick and has become one of, if not THE most iconic kicks within the media due to its frequent usage both inside & outside of combat sports such as boxing/MMA etc.. The term was originally coined from an attack performed in martial arts tournaments which involved taking half step towards your opponent then performing either an open-handed or closed fist back handed swinging motion whilst pivoting on your front foot thus turning around yourself while travelling across your body before extending the leg behind you & connecting with the target, hence making it look similar to a regular round house kick without having actually performed the preceding steps required to perform said \"attack\".\nIt is considered to be an unorthodox offensive move that should not normally be attempted except under certain circumstances, e.g when the defender's guard is down or if the user has shown proficiency in its use.\nTherefore training should begin initially by practising the individual moves first individually before attempting them all together", "score": -1.825304388999939}

That being said, there are some things you can work on in order to improve your roundhouse kicks. \n* Stance - Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, weight distributed evenly between them, and knees slightly bent. You need good balance so that you don't lose your footing during or after the kick.\n* Balance - As mentioned above, you need a lot of control and stability throughout your whole body as well as focused muscles in both legs while performing the kick for accuracy & force behind it!\n* Power generation - Proper technique requires coiling muscles like springs before delivering the strike with your leg extended behind your head as if \"snapping\" it backward. This requires power derived from your lower Bodyweight Training exercises such as squats & deadlifts combined properly along with your breath/energy release point within your movement itself when executing correctly which results In increased Speed & Accuracy making each successful strike count ! \n", "score": 1.4987618923187256}

The best way around it for eating right away would be massaging the leaves (which distributes the cell rupturing agent, peroxide) before storing, and using promptly afterwards; refrigeration slows down these chemical changes, but cannot completely halt them. Freezing will cause the leaves to go hard if allowed to thaw sufficiently before use; blanching briefly first helps prevent this..\nAn old wive\u2019s tale used to be that adding a pinch of salt made it not brown; actually all it does chemically speaking is reduce pH slightly making it less alkaline so keeping Tyropneus from forming; but it doesn`t change anything about the oxygen being there to react with", "score": -1.8186014890670776}

The largest gaps were reported by Australia & New Zealand, Europe , Latin America/Caribbean and South Asia at 38%, whereas Middle East & Africa showed the smallest difference of just over 5%. In general terms, larger economies had slightly smaller gender gaps as compared against smaller economies. \nAccording to ILO statistics from 2012, the latest year available, there are many more women employed informally than men, both in developed and developing countries.[9] Women are also more often self-employed rather then employing other staff.

Natural causes are ongoing today; these can affect the amount (not direction or trend) of global mean surface temperature for periods of up to several decades at a time, although it cannot now be determined what portion was due directly to natural influences versus indirectly through other anthropogenic (man-made) forcing such as solar or volcanism. Examples of internally generated (i.e., not related to humans or greenhouse gases) climate changes include multi-decadal ocean circulation changes that store/release heat to the atmosphere and changes in cloud amounts that alter incoming and outgoing energy balances.
